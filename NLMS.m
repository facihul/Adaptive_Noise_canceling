% NLMS.m - Normalized least mean squares algorithm
%
% Usage: [emean, y] = NLMS(d, u, mu, M, a)
%
% Inputs:
% d  - the vector of desired signal samples of size Ns,
% u  - the vector of input signal samples of size Ns,
% mu - the ï¿½ parameter,
% M  - the number of taps.
% a  - constant to mitigate norm(u) ~ 0
%
% Outputs:
% emean - the output error vector of size Ns
% y  = output coefficients
%
